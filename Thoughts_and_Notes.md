# Thoughts and Notes

## 2025-01-05

- more i am working on this project i am thinking this might end up like my mediawiki project ironically the mediawiki project structure changed very often it was a project structure nightmare.
- I will focus this week to come up with a structure that is best for my use case.

- Glad to see many youtube sources to learn more about the technology i am definitely excited to see what others are thinking about this.

- Is it worth while to collaborate with wider group to keep this repo centralised for a small community? probably will do it in future not now.

- while reading about keycloak i found that more and more companies and enterprise grade applications use this platform for managing idam for their usecase. Looks like i made a valid choice.
- This project might be useful to other fellow technology enthusiasts so i will go with MIT License for the repository.
- More i read about this i realise keycloak guys have made it so much easy for the mere humans to get started and use keycloak in the environments. 
- I am spiraling and going deep in to the explorative rabbit hole so probably need to create a scope for the repo to keep it on track and specific to what i need to do.

- Started the project basically want to understand more about idam and keycloak.
- How about setting up keycloak as a central identity provider for my homelab. This might be an overkill but i get to have fun.

> If you don't enjoy doing something there is no point in doing it after 5 PM.

- I just looked at the [Keycloak.org Guides](https://www.keycloak.org/guides) this is one of the best self build guides i came across.
- I am just gonna interpret the docs from there and document for my understanding.
- Every project requires scope so we keep our explorative lens in check.
- After the python and anaconda testing mind spiral we need more structure here also remember how far AWS airflow went to? so we need a precise scope of the project.
