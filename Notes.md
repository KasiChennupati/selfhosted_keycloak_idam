- Started the project basically want to understand more about idam and keycloak.
- How about setting up keycloak as a central identity provider for my homelab. This might be an overkill but i get to have fun. 

> If you don't enjoy doing something there is no point in doing it after 5 PM.

- I just looked at the [Keycloak.org Guides](https://www.keycloak.org/guides) this is one of the best self build guides i came across.
- I am just gonna interpret the docs from there and document for my understanding.
- Every project requires scope so we keep our explorative lens in check.
- After the python and anaconda testing mind spiral we need more structure here also remember how far AWS airflow went to? so we need a precise scope of the project.
