# Self Hosted Keycloak

This project is created to expand the understanding of the IDAM tool Keycloak and understand how the tool can be selfhosted in a home server or in a scalable environment.

This is part of my personal learning stack for this year *__2025__*.

> __Note__: [Keycloak.org Guides](https://www.keycloak.org/guides) has almost all the guidance needed for setting up a self hosted instance of keycloak.

You can get up and running with docker in a minute with the keycloak provided documentation

## Scope

Create an independent self hosted version of keycloak for users management, social account authentication, Customisable login, signup, otp, and magic link based user validation for home server suitable applications.
